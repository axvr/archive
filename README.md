# Code Dump


A repository full of random code which I have written, some is just general
testing others are actual functioning programs. Come and take a look around the
"Code Dumpster", you may find something useful.

Feel free to use or modify any of this code where ever and how ever you like
(within the scope of the licence). Everything here is unlicenced and in the
public domain, unless otherwise stated.

### Some of the fully functional programs

* **[Vivid-Legacy.vim]** - The code from before the
  [rewrite](https://github.com/axvr/Vivid.vim). This version was a fork of
  [Vundle.vim](https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim).
* **[Vim-startuptime-benchmark]** - A program to analyse the start-up-times of
  different plugin managers for the [Vim text editor](http://www.vim.org).
* **[Local-NuPkg]** - A small shell script to simplify the process of installing
  downloaded [NuGet](https://nuget.org) packages for .NET Core, without having
  to use/configure a feed. This is a feature missing from the `dotnet-cli`.
* **[GNOME Theme Switcher]** - A simple bash script to allow modifying a large
  number of GNOME settings at once, esentially creating "complete themes". For
  more info [see here](https://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn/comments/73l9qg/gnome_script_to_switch_gnome_themes/).
* **[ParamParse]** - A simple and lightweight Python parameter parsing module.
  This is functional as is, but there was a planned second method of parsing.
* **[Light Python Games]** - Collection of simple games in python, that I wrote
  when starting to learn programming in late 2015.
* And others (browse around the repository for these).


### Some incomplete/depreciated programs

* **[ALIS]** - [Arch Linux] Installation Script. Was going to be renamed to
  Archaic - The Primitive [Arch Linux] Installer, but I abandoned the project in
  late 2017 to focus on other tasks. ALIS had reached in insane level of code
  complexity, that a second rewrite was required to keep it maintainable (I was
  very new to programming at the time). A full explanation can be found in the
  Project's [`README.md`](https://github.com/axvr/ALIS/blob/master/README.md).
* **[http-req]** - PowerShell script/wrapper to easily and quickly invoke HTTP
  requests using the `Invoke-WebRequest` PowerShell command.

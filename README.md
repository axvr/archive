# Code archive

An archive of random code, programming notes and project assets I have created,
ranging from experiments to fully functioning programs.

Everything here is dedicated to the public domain, unless otherwise stated.


## Mildly interesting

- [Timeline of my archived projects](timeline.md)
- [My open source contributions](contributions.md)

# Code Dumpster Dive - codedump


A repository full of random code which I have written, some is just general testing others are actual functioning programs. Come and take a look around the "Code Dumpster", you may find something useful.

*Do not expect that this repo will be well organised, because it most likely won't.*

Feel free to use or modify any of this code where ever and how ever you like (within the scope of the licence). Everything here is unlicenced and in the public domain, unless otherwise stated.

### Some of the full programs

* **[ParamParse]** - A simple and lightweight Python parameter parsing module.
* **[Vim-startuptime-benchmark]** - A program to analyse the start-up-times of different plugin managers for the [Vim text editor](http://vim.org)
* and others

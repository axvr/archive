# Code archive

An archive of random code, programming notes and project assets I have created,
ranging from experiments to fully functioning programs.


## Mildly interesting

- [Timeline of my archived projects](timeline.md).
- [My open source contributions](contributions.md).
- My favourite bits of code in this repo:
  - [Adding non-determinism to Clojure](2025/nondeterm-try).
  - [Extending O'Doyle rules engine](2024/en-rule).
  - [CLI tool to open the Common Lisp Hyperspec for a given symbol](2022/clhs-lookup).

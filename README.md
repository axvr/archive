# Code Dump


A repository full of random code which I have written, some is just general
testing others are actual functioning programs. Come and take a look around the
"Code Dumpster", you may find something useful.

Feel free to use or modify any of this code where ever and how ever you like
(within the scope of the licence). Everything here is unlicenced and in the
public domain, unless otherwise stated.

### Some of the fully functional programs

* **[Vivid-Legacy.vim]** - The code from before the
  [rewrite](https://github.com/axvr/Vivid.vim). This version was a fork of
  [Vundle.vim](https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim).
* **[Vim-startuptime-benchmark]** - A program to analyse the start-up-times of
  different plugin managers for the [Vim text editor](http://vim.org).
* **[ParamParse]** - A simple and lightweight Python parameter parsing module.
  This is functional as is, but there was a planned second method of parsing.
* **[Light Python Games]** - Collection of simple games in python, that I wrote
  when starting to learn programming in late 2015.
* And others (browse around the repository for these).


### Some incomplete/depreciated programs

* **[ALIS]** - [Arch Linux] Installation Script. Was going to be renamed to
  Archaic - The [Arch Linux] Installer, but I abandoned the project in late 2017
  to focus on other tasks. ALIS had reached in insane level of code complexity,
  that a second rewite was required to keep it maintainable (I was very new to
  programming at the time). A full explanation is in the Project's
  [`README.md`](https://github.com/axvr/ALIS/blob/master/README.md).
* **[http-req]** - PowerShell script/wrapper to easily and quickly invoke HTTP requests
  using the `Invoke-WebRequest` PowerShell command.

# Code Dump


A repository full of random code which I have written, some is just general
testing others are actual functioning programs. Come and take a look around the
"Code Dumpster", you may find something useful.

Feel free to use or modify any of this code where ever and how ever you like
(within the scope of the licence). Everything here is unlicenced and in the
public domain, unless otherwise stated.

### Some of the fully functional programs

* **[Vivid-Legacy.vim]** - The code from before the
  [rewrite](https://github.com/axvr/Vivid.vim). This version was a fork of
  [Vundle.vim](https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim).
* **[OmniSharp-Manager]** - A super simple shell script to make installing and
  updating OmniSharp easier. It was originally created for use in
  [dotnet.vim](https://github.com/axvr/dotnet.vim).
* **[Vim-startuptime-benchmark]** - A program to analyse the start-up-times of
  different plugin managers for the [Vim text editor](http://www.vim.org).
* **[Local-NuPkg]** - A small shell script to simplify the process of installing
  downloaded [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org) packages for .NET Core, without
  having to use/configure a feed. This is a feature missing from the
  [`dotnet-cli`](https://github.com/dotnet/cli) (v2.0).
* **[GNOME Theme Switcher]** - A simple bash script to allow modifying a large
  number of GNOME settings at once, esentially creating "complete themes". For
  more info [see here](https://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn/comments/73l9qg/gnome_script_to_switch_gnome_themes/).
* And others (browse around the repository for these).


### Some incomplete/obsolete programs

* **[ALIS]** - [Arch Linux] Installation Script. Was going to be renamed to
  Archaic - The Primitive [Arch Linux] Installer, but I abandoned the project in
  late 2017 to focus on other tasks. ALIS had reached in insane level of code
  complexity, that a second rewrite was required to keep it maintainable (I was
  very new to programming at the time). A full explanation can be found in the
  Project's [`README.md`](https://github.com/axvr/ALIS/blob/master/README.md).

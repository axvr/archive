# Entities

_2024-07-10 – 2024-08-01_

Experiments in entities being living things within a system rather than
creating a system of CRUD operations.  We keep trying to model living processes
as mechanical/dead operations ones.  Let's bring them to life and make them
active participants in the system.

I really like this concept and wish to explore it further.

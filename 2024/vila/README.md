# Vila üßö‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

___An interactive, runtime focused .NET CIL assembler.___

Vila (Virtual-(C)IL Assembler) is an attempt at a [.NET][] CIL ([Common Intermediate Language][CIL])
assembler designed for use at runtime, usually interactively.


## Goals

1. Serve as a platform to learn the CLR and CIL.
2. Function interactively at runtime.
3. Be a readily available, cross-platform alternative to Microsoft's ILasm tool.
4. Perform some optimisations and code validation.
5. (Stretch) provide an easier to use interface as a compilation target for runtime based .NET languages.

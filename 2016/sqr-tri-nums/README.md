On the 13th of July 2016, Matt Parker released a video to his YouTube channel
titled "[Puzzle: Is 36 the only triangle-square
number?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gh8h8MJFFdI)".  This video inspired me
to try and write a small program to solve the question he posed by calculating
which numbers are both triangle and square numbers.

3 years later, it is clear that this program was extremely inefficient;
I decided to see how fast I could make it.  The optimised versions are in the
[improved](improved) folder.

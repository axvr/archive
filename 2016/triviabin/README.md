_6thâ€“16th November 2016_

This was my first large programming project, done as part of the second year of
my Computer Science A-Level.  Unfortunately, it is built with VisualBasic .NET.
As you might imagine, the code is horrifically bad.

I rediscovered it 6 years later (late 2022) laying around on an old hard drive.
IIRC, there was supposed to be a more in-depth document covering the purpose
and implementation, but it seems that has been forever lost.

After completing this, I ended up getting really into programming; starting my
first personal programming project [ALIS](https://github.com/axvr/ALIS) just
one month later.

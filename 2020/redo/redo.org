My implementation of redo will not use environment variables to pass the CLI
options between the tools. Use a configuration file (~.redo/rc~).

Main redo program creates the file. The others may only read from it (share
reading code between the tools).

This allows multiple different builds to occur at the same time with my redo
implementation.

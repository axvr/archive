Project management tools are too complicated, too rigid, too controlling and
focus on the wrong things.  No tickets, no bugs, just todos and documents.

Maintain in version control alongside the code?

-----------------------

TODO / DOING / DONE

TODO buckets: Soon / Whenever / Maybe

Sort within those buckets.

-----------------------

Single line TODOs.
Optional expansion files, largely left up to the owners to write and structure.

3-digit base 36 IDs?

Separate todo stores for different project areas.

-----------------------

My todo title

Owner: ...

Description.

Outliner-based rather than ticket based.  Embed within a repo?

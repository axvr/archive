# STAMP and Depict + PASTA experiments as Clojure eDSLs

_2025-01-16 â€“ 2025-01-26_

Experiment with STAMP analyses, <https://github.com/mstone/depict> and
[PASTA](https://github.com/kieler/pasta/blob/master/extension/README.md) as
Clojure eDSLs.

Attempted to utilise D2 as a backend for a Depict clone, but D2 isn't suitable
for such diagrams.

I think something along these lines is needed, but maybe not exactly this...

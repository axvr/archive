# ParamParse

**Created**: Mid 2017

This is an overly complex and experimental python parameter parser module.
Seriously though, don't use this. I have no idea what I was thinking. I was
still extremely new to programming at the time, so cut me some slack here.

The biggest issue with this module, is that it returns all of the information as
a list, instead of a dictionary. This means that it is way too difficult to
actually use within a program. However on the plus side, the concept is a pretty
neat one.

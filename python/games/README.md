# Light Python Games - lightpygames

**This was originally (December 2015) released under the GPLv2 but I have now changed it to be unlicenced**

This repository contains simple, and extremely lightweight python games I have written. It also contains the most lightweight version of Rock, Paper, Scissors (and the Lizard, Spock version) ever made in python. All the games currently have both a working Python 2.7 and Python 3.4 versions of the code.

In this repository there is a core version of the games and an advanced version of the games also; the core version is the base of the game, this is what would be used to make your own version as it contains the essentials needed for the game (but are still perfectly functional as a game by it's self). The advanced versions use the core versions of the game, but add extra functionality to them, such as: multiple rounds, score counters and the rules.

The Games:
>Rock, Paper, Scissors (Core & Advanced)

>Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock (Core & Advanced)

Within the code for each of the games there are lots of comments to aid with the modification of the code, especially since some (e.g. rps) use some very strange mechanics to be as lightweight as possible and  work incredibly effiently. These comments can be removed to make the code more lightweight if need be. Where the comments are between the lines no space is needed there so then the code can be made as short as is specified in the file, and minimise the size of the program.

Feel free to use or modify this code where ever and how ever you like.

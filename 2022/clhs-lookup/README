== Common Lisp Hyperspec symbol lookup ==

2022-04-08

Clojure code to generate a file containing every Common Lisp symbol and its
relevant page on the Common Lisp Hyperspec.

The generated file is at: https://gist.githubusercontent.com/axvr/fd3ca01cafe32dee67317c6bf6ab5be1/raw/12a10597f8d89a22beb6ccbad7d032cf0b380c8b/symbols.lisp

I've included a script which takes a CL symbol and opens the hyperspec page for
it in the web browser.  You may need to change the `open-urls` command to
something else.

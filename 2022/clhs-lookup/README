== Common Lisp Hyperspec symbol lookup ==

2022-04-08

Clojure code to generate a file containing every Common Lisp symbol and its
relevant page on the Common Lisp Hyperspec.

The generated file is at: https://paste.sr.ht/~axvr/6fd24191e38d2ac006cd5e0107cb1d68cf007bf6

I've included a script which takes a CL symbol and opens the hyperspec page for
it in the web browser.  You may need to change the `open-urls` command to
something else.

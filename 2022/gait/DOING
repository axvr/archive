- Design the internal data layout of the network.
  - Do not limit the names of modules and collections.
    - IDs for collections need to be unique though.
    - So perhaps they should be restricted to reverse domain names?
    - Otherwise you could maliciously make the ID the same as another.
- Create a function to add a new module to a network.

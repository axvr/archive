# Dirigo

The micro web-forwarding and link shortener service that I used to use for
`axvr.uk` until I got tired of self-hosting it.

This version was in the middle of a migration away from Trafik to bring ACME
certifcate refreshing into this Clojure service.  I unfortunately never
finished that move so this latest version remains broken.  Check back through
the Git history if you want to find a working version.

Maybe Dirigo will return some day if I decide to self-host again.

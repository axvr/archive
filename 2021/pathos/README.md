# Pathos

_6th September 2021 â€“ 12th November 2021_

An incomplete Clojure library for sane handling of OS file paths as proper data
structures.  (One day I may convert this into a proper library.)

The `src` directory contains 3 different implementations.


## Rationale

- Source of bugs and arbitrary limitations (proper Unicode support).
- Duplicate/platform dependent code.
- Cannot reuse code easily.
- Requires writing ad-hoc parsers in every program.

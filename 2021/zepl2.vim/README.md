# Zepl2.vim experimentation

_Februrary 2021 â€“ August 2021_

Experimentation for a possible v2 of [Zepl.vim](https://github.com/axvr/zepl.vim).

This version was planned to have a nicer REPL view (not using Vim's `:terminal`)
with a new internal design allowing for better language support including
in-REPL syntax highlighting, sending hidden messages to the REPL, extracting
responses from the REPL.

See the `NOTES` file for more information.

# Slowest Conway's Game of Life

_5th August 2021_

This is an unfinished implementation of John Conway's Game of Life.  The plan
was for it to use the GitHub contribution chart as it's output making it
possibly the slowest implementation: taking an entire year to complete a single
iteration.  You can think of it as an unfinished "art" piece.

I tried to implement it using a non-standard data structure (better matching
the GitHub contribution timeline), but it ended up not working, so I never
finished it.

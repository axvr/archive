# GNOME Theme Switcher

### 2017-09 &ndash; 2017-10

In an attempt to automate the set up of my Fedora Linux desktop installation,
I had wanted a way to quickly switch between different themes, toggle
extensions, and change system settings quickly.  These options were grouped
into what I called "complete themes".  The result was extracted into a Bash
script, and has had a few minor tweaks since.

[I announced it on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn/comments/73l9qg/gnome_script_to_switch_gnome_themes/),
and the response was completely unexpected (I honestly expected no one to care).
However shortly after the announcement, I stopped using it as I became contempt
with stock GNOME and it was a huge hassle to install GNOME extensions at the
time.

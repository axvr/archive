# ParamParse

### Mid-2017

This was an overly complex and experimental python command-line argument parser
library.  What made is particularly complex is that it returned a matrix,
containing a large number of items, which should have been stored in dictionary
form at the very least.  Usage of this library would have be a source of many
bugs and pain.  On the plus side, the concept was quite neat.

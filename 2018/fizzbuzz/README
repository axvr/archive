== Fizzbuzz ==

2018-11

Although I had been programming for a while before this, this was still my
first time ever writing fizzbizz.  I decided to write 2 versions (using
identical logic flow) and compare the performance differences between the two.
Surprisingly there was a huge performance difference.  I'm still not actually
sure why.

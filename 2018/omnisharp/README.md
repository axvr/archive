# OmniSharp-Manager

### 2018

_Public domain.  No rights reserved._

This was a simple script to automate the installation of the
[OmniSharp-Roslyn](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-roslyn/) server.
This script eventually became part of [OmniSharp-Vim][O# vim] which greatly
streamlined the set up of a C# development environment in Vim for Unix-like
OSs.  Shortly after that, I created a sister script written in PowerShell to
automate the installation on Microsoft Windows.

This is an old version of the script; various bug fixes and improvements have
been made to this script in the [upstream O#-Vim repo][O# installers].

(**NOTE:** only this copy of the script is in public domain.  The version in
the O#-Vim repo is available under the same terms as [OmniSharp-Vim][O# licence].)

Helper scripts made throughout 2018.

`align' and `wtf' are small scripts to aid with some editing tasks while I was
still learning to use standard Unix utilities and Vim.

The purpose of the other scripts was to act as an abstract interface/wrapper
around various tools and systems to allow window managers to interact with
parts of the system.  These scripts would attempt to determine the correct way
to achieve what was requested as best it could.

The only one I was (and still am) quite proud of is the `audio` script although
it remained unfinished.

== Lispy experiments ==

Very early code from my first experiments with the Lisp family of languages.

The `objects.clj` file is older of the two, it was created during one of my
many failed attempts to learn Clojure.  (Sadly I have lost all the other code
from those failed attempts.)

The `cool.scm` file was created by following along to "Scheme Lisp: Feel the
Cool" by Andy Balaam [1].  This video made it all click for me; it got me over
the initial learning curve that all the Clojure tutorials I tried had failed to
do.

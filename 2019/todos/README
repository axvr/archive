== cli todo tools ==

2019-03, 2019-07

I had been using a simple CLI todo management script I wrote on 2019-03-21
called 'ut' which was an attempt to create a simpler version of 't'[1].  'ut'
had some limitations so I decided to write a suite of simple scripts to manage
per-project and global todo lists.

I eventually stopped working on it and built an even simpler solution, however
I still have faith in this idea, even though I didn't need it in the end.

The 'DOING' file contains the plan and explains the role of each command.

#+TITLE: NANDC language spec design

- S-expressions.
- Building components/abstraction layers.
- Explicitly specify (and name) inputs and outputs.
- Give components names and descriptions (doc strings).
- Changes to an existing component propagate.
- Canvas.
- Components.
- Components can recursive (e.g. AND with 3+ inputs will recursively AND).
- NAND + clocks are the only primatives?
- Import/export components and projects as s-expressions.

title: NAND Compiler (NANDC)

### Building a simpler HDL (hardware description language).

What distinguishes this project from previous and existing HDLs is that the
foundations of the language are s-expressions and NAND gates.  This is possible
because NAND gates are _functionally complete_.

The combination of these 2 things results in an extremely simple, clean and
minimal language which can be easily manipulated by other programs, as it is
just a data representation.

There will likely be 2 languages built one which is for internal representation
only: the NAND trees, and the second is a more Lisp-like language with lots of
useful features.

The NAND s-expression trees will allow for experimentation with what I call
"recursive pattern-matching optimisation", where the system recursively travels
across the tree looking for known inputs and outputs and replacing the
components with pre-defined more-optimised ones.  This should be efficient and
simple due the tree only containing NAND gates, so there are significantly less
possible options.

There will be a second compilation layer which expands each NAND gate into
their most optimised counter-parts.

## Possible syntax for the NAND s-expression trees

```
and: ((a b) (a b))
not: (a a)
or:  ((a a) (b b))
nor: (((a a) (b b))
      ((a a) (b b)))
xor: ((a (a b))
      (b (a b)))
```

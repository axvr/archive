(Light Python Games - lightpygames)

During my first year of computer science classes we were given a series of
tasks to complete in Python.  One of these tasks was to create a simple version
of "Rock, paper, scissors".  I ended up creating what may very well have been
the smallest Python implementation of the game at the time.â€‰

After that, I built a slightly more advanced version which handled stuff such
as best of 3, printing the rules, etc.

The source code for each is linked below (they have all since been placed into
the public domain):

- Rock, paper, scissors ([core](rps_core.py), [advanced](rps_adv.py))
- Rock, paper, scissors, lizard, Spock ([core](rpsls_core.py), [advanced](rpsls_adv.py))
